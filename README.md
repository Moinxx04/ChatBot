<h1>P4.Implementation of Chatbot using NLP</h1>

This project develops a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enable natural, human-like conversations. Built with Python and Flask, the chatbot processes user input, classifies it into intents, and provides relevant responses. By utilizing NLTK for text processing and scikit-learn for machine learning, the system can understand and respond to various queries, making it suitable for applications like customer service and virtual assistance.
